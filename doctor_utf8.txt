Γ£û Check Expo config (app.json/ app.config.js) schema
Error validating fields in C:\Users\U4652G6\Documents\rezoa\project_v1\rezoa-mobile\app.json:
 Field: android - should NOT have additional property 'playback'.
Advice:
Resolve schema errors in your app config. Learn more: https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/configuration/

Γ£û Check that native modules use compatible support package versions for installed Expo SDK
Expected package @expo/metro-config@~0.20.18
Found invalid:
  @expo/metro-config@0.20.17
  (for more info, run: npm why @expo/metro-config)
Advice:
Upgrade dependencies that are using the invalid package versions.

Γ£û Check for app config fields that may not be synced in a non-CNG project
This project contains native project folders but also has native configuration properties in app.json, indicating it is configured to use Prebuild. When the android/ios folders are present, EAS Build will not sync the following properties: orientation, icon, scheme, userInterfaceStyle, ios, android, plugins, androidStatusBar. 


Γ£û Validate packages against React Native Directory package metadata
The following issues were found when validating your dependencies against React Native Directory:
  Unmaintained: expo-av
Advice:
Use libraries that are actively maintained and support the New Architecture. Find alternative libraries with https://reactnative.directory.
Add packages to expo.doctor.reactNativeDirectoryCheck.exclude in package.json to selectively skip validations, if the warning is not relevant.

Γ£û Check that packages match versions required by installed Expo SDK
The following packages should be updated for best compatibility with the installed expo version:
  expo@53.0.20 - expected version: ~53.0.25
  expo-constants@17.1.7 - expected version: ~17.1.8
  expo-image@2.4.0 - expected version: ~2.4.1
  expo-router@5.1.4 - expected version: ~5.1.10
  expo-system-ui@5.0.10 - expected version: ~5.0.11
  react-native@0.79.5 - expected version: 0.79.6
Your project may not work correctly until you install the expected versions of the packages.
Found outdated dependencies
Advice:
Use 'npx expo install --check' to review and upgrade your dependencies.
To ignore specific packages, add them to "expo.install.exclude" in package.json. Learn more: https://expo.fyi/dependency-validation
