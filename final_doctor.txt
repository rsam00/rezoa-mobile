Γ£û Check Expo config (app.json/ app.config.js) schema
Γ£û Check dependencies for packages that should not be installed directly
The package "@expo/metro-config" should not be installed directly in your project. You should instead use "expo/metro-config" which is a sub-export of the expo package.
Advice:
Remove these packages from your package.json.

Γ£û Check that native modules use compatible support package versions for installed Expo SDK
Γ£û Check for app config fields that may not be synced in a non-CNG project
This project contains native project folders but also has native configuration properties in app.json, indicating it is configured to use Prebuild. When the android/ios folders are present, EAS Build will not sync the following properties: orientation, icon, scheme, userInterfaceStyle, ios, android, plugins, androidStatusBar.
