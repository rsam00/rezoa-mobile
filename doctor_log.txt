✖ Check Expo config (app.json/ app.config.js) schema
Error validating fields in C:\Users\U4652G6\Documents\rezoa\project_v1\rezoa-mobile\app.json:
 Field: android - should NOT have additional property 'usesCleartextTraffic'.

✖ Check for app config fields that may not be synced in a non-CNG project
This project contains native project folders but also has native configuration properties in app.json, indicating it is configured to use Prebuild. When the android/ios folders are present, EAS Build will not sync the following properties: orientation, icon, scheme, userInterfaceStyle, ios, android, plugins, androidStatusBar. 


✖ Check that packages match versions required by installed Expo SDK
The following packages should be updated for best compatibility with the installed expo version:
  expo@53.0.25 - expected version: ~53.0.26
  expo-router@5.1.10 - expected version: ~5.1.11
  react-native-svg@15.15.1 - expected version: 15.11.2
Your project may not work correctly until you install the expected versions of the packages.
